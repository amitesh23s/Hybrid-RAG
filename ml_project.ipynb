      "\n",
      "**Operating Performance:**\n",
      "Operating expenses have increased by 35% primarily due to higher salaries, wages, and other expenses. As a result, operating profit has decreased by 12%. The operating margin has also declined from 15.6% to 13.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Net Income:**\n",
      "Net income has increased by 18% to Rs. 178,422 due to a significant improvement in non-operating income, mainly driven by investments. The net margin has expanded from 10.1% to 11.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cash Flow:**\n",
      "The company's cash and cash equivalents have decreased by 22% from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024, primarily due to higher investments and working capital requirements. However, the company's other bank balances have increased, indicating a strong liquidity position.\n",

      "**Balance Sheet:**\n",
      "The company's total assets have increased by 75% primarily due to growth in investments and trade receivables. Equity has also increased by 68%, driven by retained earnings and other reserves. The debt-to-equity ratio has remained relatively stable at around 0.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the company's financial performance has been mixed, with revenue and net income growth offset by declining gross and operating margins. The company's liquidity and capital structure remain strong, but it may need to focus on improving its operating efficiency to drive sustainable growth.\n"
